# Summary of boutique-store-app(gadget-shop-app)

This is a PERN ecommerce website that serve for the purpose of gadget business. This application was developed by use react, MUI, and redux for frontend. While for the backend express, postgresql, bcryptjs was used. This application have recorded payment scheme as one of the table. At the moment I use the databases locally, but I could migrate to supabase if necessary. In the future admin panel will be added, to monitor the entire operation of the business. Other SSL features features could be added, depends on the requirement.
